# FAQ

## 1. What Is CISA’s Logging Made Easy (LME)?

LME is a no-cost log management solution for small- to medium-sized organizations with limited resources that would otherwise have little to no functionality to detect attacks. LME offers centralized logging for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems, enabling proactive threat detection and enhanced security by allowing organizations to monitor their networks, identify users, and actively analyze Sysmon data to quickly detect potential malicious activity.

## 2. What makes LME unique?

LME stands out as an accessible, open source log management and threat detection solution developed by CISA to support organizations with limited resources. By integrating Elastic and Wazuh in a secure, containerized stack, it provides endpoint security and real-time alerting without the complexity or cost of traditional SIEMs. Designed with customizable dashboards and Secure by Design principles, LME offers a user-friendly, effective solution to enhance visibility and strengthen threat detection.

## 3. What software drives LME?

LME is powered by Elastic Stack (for log management, search, and visualization), Wazuh (for endpoint detection and response), and Podman (for containerization). This open source stack ensures transparency, flexibility and scalability while providing enhanced threat detection and customizable dashboards.

## 4. Which operating systems can use LME?

LME 2.0 supports Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. Elastic and Wazuh agents enable compatibility across these platforms, ensuring broad coverage for monitoring and logging. While Wazuh agents also support Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX operating systems, CISA has not tested LME on endpoints running these operating systems.

## 5. Who can use LME?

<<<<<<< HEAD
While intended for small to medium-sized organizations with limited resources, anyone can download and use LME. Reference [LME 2.0 Prerequisite documentation](docs/markdown/prerequisites.md) for more details on required infrastructure and hardware including CPU, memory, and storage requirements.
