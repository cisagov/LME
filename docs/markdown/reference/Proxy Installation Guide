# Proxy Installation Guide

To enhance visibility into network activity and ensure comprehensive log collection, installing a proxy server is a practical first step. A proxy acts as an intermediary between users and the internet, allowing organizations to monitor, filter, and log outbound traffic in a centralized way. This guide walks you through the basic steps for installing and configuring a proxy server, helping you lay the groundwork for more effective logging and improved security posture.

1. **Ensure Proxy Environment Variables are Set**
   - Define your proxy settings in the system environment so all outgoing traffic can route through it.
   - Edit the environment file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/environment
   ```

   - Add the following lines, replacing $proxy with your actual proxy URL:

   ```bash
   ALL_PROXY=$PROXY
   HTTPS_PROXY=$PROXY
   HTTP_PROXY=$PROXY
   http_proxy=$PROXY
   https_proxy=$PROXY
   no_proxy=127.0.0.1,localhost,::1,10.,172.16.,172.17.,192.168.,*.local,.local
   NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost,::1,10.,172.16.,172.17.,192.168.,*.local,.local
   REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
   NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
   ```

   - Save and exit the file, then reload the environment variables:

   ```bash
   source /etc/environment
   ```

2. **Ensure Certificates are Up to Date**
   -To avoid connection issues when accessing secure resources through a proxy, ensure your certificate store is current:

   ```bash
   cd /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
   # add corporation root ca pem files now
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

3. **Edit the podman Files to Ignore http Proxy**
   - Some components in LME, such as containers managed by Podman, may not need to use the proxy - especially if they communicate locally. You can prevent proxy use within specific containers by adjusting the runtime flags.
   - In LME/quadlets, run the following command:

   ```bash
   for file in *.container; do
    echo "$file"
    sed -i '/^PodmanArgs/ s/$/ --http-proxy=false/' "$file"
    done
    ```

    - This command clears the proxy settings within the container, avoiding potential network issues with internal-only communications.

**Conclusion**

Proper proxy configuration ensures LME can fetch dependencies, send telemetry, and access internet resources securely and reliably - all while remaining compliant with your network's security policies. With your environment variables in place, certificates verified, and container flags configured, your deployment is now more robust and ready for production logging scenarios.
