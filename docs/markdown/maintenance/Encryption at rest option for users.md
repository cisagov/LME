# Encryption at rest option for users.md

To ensure encryption at rest for all data managed by Elastic Cloud Enterprise, the hosts running Elastic Cloud Enterprise must be configured with disk-level encrytption, such as dm-crypt. Elastic Cloud Enterprise does not implement encryption at rest out of the box.

Since Elastic doesn't support data encryption at rest, it provides a paid option outside of disk-level encryption available to users. This option is called X-pack.

X-pack is a security feature that provides a secure and compliant way to protect data in Elasticsearch.

X-pack has a 30-day trial and once trial is over, users might need to acquire a platium license if they want to keep us some of the X-pack features including the data encryption.
