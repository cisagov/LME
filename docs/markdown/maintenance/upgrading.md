# Upgrading 
This page serves as a landing page for future upgrading when we release new versions. 

## Upgrading for Existing LME 1.4 Users:
Currently the only upgrade path is from 1.4 -> 2.0 [Click here for more information on upgrading from LME 1.4](/scripts/upgrade/README.md).

### Other LME 1.X versions:
Before upgrading to 2.0, we highly recommend upgrading to 1.4 if you are using an earlier version as that is the only supported upgrade path defined in the link above.
