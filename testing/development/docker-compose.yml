# 
# This file defines two services:
# 1. ubuntu:
#    - Builds an Ubuntu container with the specified USER_ID and GROUP_ID arguments.
#    - Mounts the parent directory to /lme in the container, allowing access to the LME project.
#    - Sets the container name to "lme_development".
#    - Sets the user to the specified HOST_UID and HOST_GID.
#    - Runs the command "sleep infinity" to keep the container running indefinitely.
# 
# 2. lme:
#    - Builds a container using the Dockerfile located in ../../ directory.
#    - Uses the specified USER_ID and GROUP_ID arguments.
#    - Sets the container name to "lme".
#    - Sets the user to the specified HOST_UID and HOST_GID.
#    - Mounts the parent directory to /home/admin.ackbar/LME in the container, allowing access to the LME project.
#    - Runs the command "sleep infinity" to keep the container running indefinitely.
#    - Exposes the following ports: 443, 9200, 9300, 5000, 9600, 5601.
