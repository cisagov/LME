# SetupTestbed.ps1
This script creates a "blank slate" for testing/configuring LME.

Using the Azure CLI, it creates the following:
- A resource group
- A virtual network, subnet and network security group
- 2 VMs: "DC1," a Windows server, and "LS1," a Linux server
- Client VMs: Windows clients "C1", "C2", etc. up to 16 based on user input 
- Promotes DC1 to a domain controller
- Adds C1 to the managed domain
- Adds a DNS entry pointing to LS1

This script does not install LME. It simply creates a fresh environment that's ready to have LME installed.

| 1     | Open a cloud shell by navigating to portal.azure.com and clicking the shell icon.                                                                                                                                                             | ![image](/docs/imgs/testing-screenshots/shell.png)      |
| 2     | Select PowerShell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ![image](/docs/imgs/testing-screenshots/shell2.png)     |
| 3     | Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/cisagov/LME.git` and then `cd LME\testing`                                                                                                                                                       |  |
| 4     | Run the script, providing values for the parameters when promoted (see [Usage](#usage)). The script will take approxmiately 20 minutes to run to completion.                                                                                  | ![image](/docs/imgs/testing-screenshots/shell4.png)     |
| 5     | Save the login credentials printed to the terminal at the end (They will also be in a file called `<$ResourceGroup>.password.txt`). At this point you can login to each VM using RDP (for the Windows servers) or SSH (for the Linux server). | ![image](/docs/imgs/testing-screenshots/shell5.png)     |
| 6     | When you're done testing, simply delete the resource group to clean up all resources created.                                                                                                                                                 | ![image](/docs/imgs/testing-screenshots/delete.png)     |

# Extra Functionality:
 
## Clean Up ResourceGroup: 

1. open a shell like before 
2. run command: `az group delete --name [NAME_YOUP_ROVIDED_ABOVE]`

## Disable Internet: 
Run the following commands in the azure shell.  

```powershell
./internet_toggle.ps1 -RG [NAME_YOU_PROVIDED_ABOVE] [-NSG OPTIONAL_NSG_GROUP] [-enable]
```

Flags:
  - enable: deletes the DENYINTERNET/DENYLOADBALANCER rules
  - NSG: sets NSG to a custom NSG if desired [NSG1 default]

| 3.a   | If you have already cloned the LME repo then make sure you are in the  `LME\testing` directory and run git pull before changing to the testing directory. |                                                       |
| 3.b   | If you haven't cloned it, clone the github repo in the home directory. `git clone https://github.com/cisagov/LME.git` and then `cd LME\testing`.          |                                                       |
| 4     | Now you can run one of the commands from the Examples above.                                                                                              |                                                       |
| 5     | Save the login credentials printed to the terminal at the end. *See note*                                                                                 |                                                       |
| 6     | When you're done testing, simply delete the resource group to clean up all resources created.                                                             |                                                       |

Note: When the script finishes you will be in the azure_scripts directory. You should see the elasticsearch credentials printed to the terminal. 
You will need to `cd ../../` to get back to the LME directory. All the passwords should be in the `<$ResourceGroup>.password.txt` file.
